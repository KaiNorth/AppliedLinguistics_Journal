Word Complexity Lexicon
=========================

lexicon.tsv : Each line consists of word and its complexity scores calculated by aggregating over human ratings. 
              The score belongs to a scale of 1-6, where 1 represents "very simple" and 6 represents "very complex"

lexion_annotations.tsv: Each line consists of a word in the lexicon and its individual ratings from 11 annotators.
                        Each rating again belongs to the scale of 1-6. -1 indicates that the annotator did not rate
                        the word.
